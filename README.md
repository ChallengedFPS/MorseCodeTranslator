# MorseCodeTranslator
Translates stuff into morse code!
This is just a very basic program I got the idea from an edabit challenge
The way i do it is by creatign a dictionary and looping through the input string and then printing the coresponding morse code for each letter,
theres probably a more efficient way but do i care? no
